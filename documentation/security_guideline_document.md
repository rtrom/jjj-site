## 1. Project Setup & Infrastructure

- **Project Initialization**
  - Use Bolt for initial project setup with Astro as the static site generator.
  - Configure a Git repository with a README outlining project goals, tech stack, and security & SEO practices.

- **Secure Repository Management**
  - Use strong authentication (two-factor authentication) for GitHub access.
  - Set up branch protection rules to secure the main branch.

- **Hosting & Deployment**
  - Prepare deployment for GitHub Pages ensuring HTTPS is enforced.
  - Configure build scripts to generate an optimized production build.

## 2. Design & Layout Planning

- **Aesthetic & Brand Guidelines**
  - Establish color palette: navy blue, white, gold/beige, and gray accents.
  - Define typography using sans-serif fonts like Inter or Poppins.
  - Ensure a modern, clean, and welcoming visual design with appropriate white space.

- **Wireframe & Component Design**
  - Sketch wireframes for each section: Hero, About, Session Details, Instagram Grid, Location, Contact, and Footer.
  - Utilize shadcn UI components with Tailwind CSS for consistency and maintainability.

- **Accessibility & SEO Considerations**
  - Use semantic HTML elements (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`).
  - Establish clear heading hierarchy (h1, h2, etc.).

## 3. Content & SEO Strategy

- **Meta Data & Structured Data**
  - Configure meta tags: title, description, keywords.
  - Implement Open Graph and Twitter Card meta tags to enhance social sharing.
  - Create a JSON-LD script for structured data including Organization, LocalBusiness, and Event details for the upcoming session.
  - Set canonical URLs for SEO best practices.

- **Sitemap & Robots.txt**
  - Generate an Astro-generated sitemap.xml for search engines.
  - Implement a robots.txt file with secure defaults, keeping sensitive paths hidden.

- **Page Copy and SEO-Optimized Content**
  - Draft and review SEO-optimized website copy that reflects the warm, inclusive tone of the fellowship and event.
  - Ensure session details (date and time) are editable and clearly marked.

## 4. Front-End Implementation

- **Hero Section**
  - Implement a prominent headline, subheadline, and a clear "Join Us" call-to-action (CTA) button.
  - Ensure the CTA has a secure link to the desired action (consider data attributes for analytics tracking).

- **About Section**
  - Write a compelling narrative on the groupâ€™s mission. Include accessibility features like alt attributes on images.
  - Ensure content is mobile-responsive and optimized for various screen sizes.

- **Session Details**
  - Display the next session details (April 26 at 5 PM) with clear, editable text.
  - Securely handle any placeholders for future date updates.

- **Instagram Grid**
  - Build a responsive grid layout with placeholder images linking to the official Instagram page.
  - Use lazy-loading for images to improve performance and reduce load times.
  - Validate URLs to prevent injection attacks.

- **Location Section**
  - Embed Google Maps iframe with proper security attributes (e.g., sandbox, allow).
  - Ensure the map loads over HTTPS and respects user privacy.

- **Contact Section**
  - Integrate a contact form using Formspree with secure input validation and CAPTCHA if available.
    - As a fallback, provide a mailto link ensuring email content is sanitized.
  - Validate and sanitize all user inputs on the client side.

- **Footer**
  - Include relevant links, organization tagline: "Faith. Fitness. Fellowship.", and optionally the group logo.
  - Ensure that all footer links are validated and open securely in new tabs where appropriate.

## 5. Analytics & Enhanced User Experience

- **Google Analytics Integration**
  - Integrate Google Analytics ensuring privacy by anonymizing IP addresses if required.
  - Validate that tracking scripts load over HTTPS to prevent data leakage.

- **Interactive Enhancements**
  - Implement scroll animations and a sticky navigation bar.
  - Ensure interactive features degrade gracefully upon failure.
  - Use secure libraries for animations and verify package integrity.

---

## 6. Performance & Optimization

- **Performance Best Practices**
  - Maintain a Lighthouse load time of under 2 seconds through optimization of assets.
  - Lazy-load non-critical images and defer non-essential JavaScript.
  - Enforce minimal CSS and tree-shake unused code.

- **Security Considerations**
  - Apply Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to limit resources from untrusted sources.
  - Set up HTTPS and secure cookies for any user state or analytics sessions.

---

## 7. Testing & Deployment

- **Local Testing**
  - Test across multiple browsers and devices to ensure responsive design and security adherence (e.g., validate input sanitization).
  - Use both automated (Lighthouse, WAVE) and manual testing for accessibility and SEO compliance.

- **Continuous Integration/Deployment**
  - Set up CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions to run build, lint, and security scans on every commit or pull-request.
  - Enforce security best practices in the build phase (SCA for dependency management).
  - Upon successful tests, deploy automatically to GitHub Pages.

---

## 8. Maintenance & Future Enhancements

- **Documentation**
  - Maintain a PRD document and update it with any new security or functional requirements.
  - Keep a changelog for future updates especially regarding session details and content updates.

- **Regular Security Audits**
